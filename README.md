# Diversequality

Hey everyone,

I built Diversequality because I care about whether we're moving forward or backward in making our society more inclusive. Every big event, legal decision, executive move, or policy shift has a real impact on communities around the world. This tool helps make sense of the news through that lens.

Share a news article or event description, and the app will provide a summary, analyze how it might advance or hinder DEI progress, and give an honest score from -100 to 100 â€” showing whether it represents a step forward or backward for inclusion.

I hope this tool helps us see beyond headlines and understand the real-world impact of events on minorities today, and on all of us tomorrow. This perspective is meaningful to me, and I hope you'll find it valuable too.

P.S. While Diversequality aims to promote understanding of DEI issues, it isn't meant to tell you what to think. It's simply one lens that can offer a different perspective.
